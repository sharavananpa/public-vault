# Synthesizers
- The word synthesizer comes from "súnthesis", a greek work meaning "to combine two or more thing" or "to put together". 
- In the context of music, synthesizer or "synth" refers to an electronic instrument made up of oscillators, filters and voltage-controlled amplifiers. 
- They produce sounds by adding and subtracting different sounds and are unlikely to be obtained from regular musical instruments.

## A Brief History of Synthesizers
- The world's first electronic instrument, ætherphone (commonly known as Theremin) was invented in 1920's by [Leon Theremin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leon_Theremin), a Russian inventor.
- In the 20s, 30s and 40s most of the efforts went into building electric organs - most notably the [Hammond organ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammond_organ) introduced in 1935.
- Then, in the  50s, with the advent of [Musique concrète](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musique_concr%C3%A8te) technique in the academic music world, synthesizers started playing a much bigger role with magnetic tapes.
- Synths got adopted in the popular space only in the late 60s. Till then, synthesizers were only used by hobbyists and were very expensive (like RCA Mark I and Mark II).
- In the late 60s popular bands like the Beatles (used [Mellotron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mellotron)) and film music world started adopting synths paving way to the birth of commercial synthesizers like the "[Minimoog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimoog)"
- Most of the music today, both popular and experimental heavily relies on synthesizers and different audio processing techniques.

## Control Voltage in Synths
- Synthesizers would produce voltages in the range of 1 volt per octave to produce the desired note - i.e. the first octave would produce 1 - 2 volts, second would produce 2 - 3 volts and so on.
- Therefore, each note would have a 1/12th of a volt increase in voltage from the lowest note to the highest.
- These voltages would go to a [voltage-controlled oscillator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage-controlled_oscillator) (VCO) that would generate the tone accordingly.
- Older synths just had a single oscillator ([monophonic synthesizers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphony_and_monophony_in_instruments)) because of the components being expensive, but modern synths have many more that can be played simultaneously allowing to play harmonies and more.
