Melodyne is a pitch correction tool that allows note-based editing of a sample / recording and helps us change the almost every characteristics of a blob. The chunks of audio content that Melodyne detects are called **blobs**. The software mostly focuses on manual tuning unlike Autotune. Celemony is the company that owns Melodyne^[https://helpcenter.celemony.com].
# ARA Version
ARA stands for **Audio Random Access**. It loads up the entire track into memory so that users don't have to record the changes before editing in Melodyne. It only works in audio tracks (in Logic Pro) and only works if it is the first insert of the channel, else it is disabled.

# Miscellaneous
- Selecting a blob in the editor disables following of the playhead.
- When using Melodyne, it is recommended to not use any effects processing that camouflages the true nature of a recording.
- When working on a mix, having a dummy lead vocal without proper processing is a bad idea and it psychologically affects the production or the mix when we discount its flaws to just get on to the work.
- It is better to go with other tuning software like Auto Tune or Meta Tune to get the T-Pain effect.
