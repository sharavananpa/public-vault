# Sound Theory
## Elements of Communication
- Communication is the transfer of information from a source (stimulus) to a destination (receptor) through a medium.
- The medium can be air, water, space or any solid objects.
- Information that is carried through natural media takes the form of waves - repeating pattern that oscillate back and forth.
- In essence, a stimulus produces energy which stimulates a medium that carries that energy as waves and received by a receptor that is configured to sympathetically tune to the particular type of wave that it is supposed to receive.
- Example: light, sound, electricity, radio waves, etc.
